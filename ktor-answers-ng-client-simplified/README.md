# KtorAnswersNgClientSimplified

This is a simplified version of the Ktor Answers Angular client containing:

* Three components (in the `components` folder)
* One service (in the `services` folder)
* Two entity classes (in the `model` folder)
* A single helper method (in `utilities\utils.ts`)

All of this is configured via the module declared in `app.module.ts`

To run go to `package.json` and launch the `start` shortcut.
